## General Info
- My project uses CSV file, storing GPS tracked data of a white stork called Mirabell (particularly latitude, longitude and date).
- These data are displayed on google map through Bokeh library framework as an interactive spots.
- For some important spots, I aded more interactivity that is, among other, redirecting you to separate page with more information about the spot (see important_spots file in the filers directory).
- The goal of the project is to show the season of the bird, its spring and autumn move and important spots where the bird settles during the season as well as to point out significant problems that are associated with these spots and life of the bird.
